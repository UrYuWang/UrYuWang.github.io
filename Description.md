This repository is for storing a project of using python and corresponding 
packages to do an analysis of US's earthquakes from 1970 to 2014. The data
is from a repository of BuzzFeed News. (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BuzzFeedNews/2015-03-earthquake-maps/master/data/earthquake_states.csv) In
the dataset, there are more than 30000 valid records (no missing values), and I use 
them to do the analysis.

There is an interesting issue that the amount of earthquakes with a magnitude
that has been rounded to one decimal place is much higher than the amount of 
earthquakes with pretty close magnitudes that have been rounded to two decimal
places. So, to reveal the real pattern, I need to change the data.

The map is not visible in the notebook file on github, but it is visible in the html file.
